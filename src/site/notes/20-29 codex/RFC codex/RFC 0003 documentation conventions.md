Introduction of the RFC format.

Direct quote from Network Working Group's original RFC 3 (from https://doi.org/10.17487/RFC0003):

> The content of a NWG note may be any thought, suggestion, etc. related to the HOST software or other aspect of the network. Notes are encouraged to be timely rather than polished. Philosophical positions without examples or other specifics, specific suggestions or implementation techniques without introductory or background explication, and explicit questions without any attempted answers are all acceptable. The minimum length for a NWG note is one sentence.
> These standards (or lack of them) are stated explicitly for two reasons. First, there is a tendency to view a written statement as ipso facto authoritative, and we hope to promote the exchange and discussion of considerably less than authoritative ideas. Second, there is a natural hesitancy to publish something unpolished, and we hope to ease this inhibition.

I will follow their lead and merely repurpose their standards for my own purposes.

By doing this, I wish to be more organized and keep a better record of my work. Also, generally, i am not tempted to write most of the days. With rfcs, i expect to be more writeative (instead of talkative).

I expect to record several things in my RFC's:
- following trails of research
- short philosophical positions
- a record of what i do in other places than my rfcs
- general organizational directives and records
- formal structure of my theories

I will probably not record such things in my RFC's:
- most philosophical argumentation outside of its mere statement
- any research that is better presented in a proper research paper format (these two i like less than an rfc format for philosophical communication)
- anything that fits a better structure (like class notes)
- any fiction writing
- journalistic writing like recording emotions or events the day; they are better suited for a journal

Different from what i am able to do and write, these rfcs will enable me to:
- determine a theme for an rfc and write an organized short document of thoughts or report in a timely manner
- do not be scared from future revisions and not give up timeliness
- feel like a cool person because i am writing formal documents based on standards and protocols (i actually already feel like this based on other similar stuff i do)

Other notes planned are on
