3 different writing styles in the same writing.

- scientific god
- pure/brutal experience
- symbolic

scientific god is objective to a radical extent.

pure experience is harder and it seems to me that best way of representing pure experience in writing is through poetic writing.

symbolics is complicated in its relation to and difference from pure experience. i always imagine some hindu gods almost playing in a cosmic theatre what is happening in reality. perhaps this is the conceptual realm that some philosophers get caught in and my mind appended hindu gods to them because of their conceptual representative nature.

i think these three writing styles are key and play a huge part in any fictional writing. if not, they should because they seem to represent real distinctions in representation.
i will try to use these as an intentional feature in my fictional writings.
